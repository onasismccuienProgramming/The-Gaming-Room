# The-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
>>The Client was Creative Technology Solutions (CTS).  They requested a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
>>I think what I did well, was recommend an OP for this client based on the current OP options
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
>>EVERYTHING!!  being able to kind of map the process, and having a better understanding about the 
architecture was extremely helpful for me.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Well, it would probably be the system architecture.  I would improve this document, by just elaborating a little bit more on the overall make up of the OP systems in general
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
>>the user's needs are what keeps us employed.  You have to cater to what the customer wants if possible.  It's important because the customer already has a vision of what they want.  You, as a designer, must try to make that vision a reality.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
>> I would start off with a UML diagram.  This is what I will use going forward.  This helps the designer to better understand what the customer is looking for, and it helps you to develop that customer vision based on a step by step process.
